This is the old version of [DietCLI](https://github.com/hstsethi/dietcli), a blazingly fast, cross-platform, command line nutrition tracker written in C++. Please head over to the DietCLI repository because this version is uploaded here just for historical purposes. It is not supported anymore. Additionally, it is also slower than DietCLI, has less features.
